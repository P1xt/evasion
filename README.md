# evasion
Quick prototype game for demo of the Phase framework (uses existing code I had on hand)

Boilerplate includes the latest versions of:    
jQuery    
Bootstrap     
Font Awesome     
Phaser    

There's no build process or anything to get in your way, just an index.html, css file and javascript file (the game is in scripts/evasion.js) so tweaking it for whatever you need should be pretty straightforward.

Note the CNAME file. If you want to use surge.sh to host your project, simply install surge, change what's in the CNAME file to the URL you want on surge for your project, then type surge from within the main directory of your game (where your index.html file is).
